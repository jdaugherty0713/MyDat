           The Complete NetHack Acronym and Abbreviation List
          ====================================================

          originally by Satoshi Asami (asami@cs.berkeley.edu),
      with some additions by Boudewijn Wayers (kroisos@win.tue.nl)
          and a lot by Adam Dawes (Adam@beachyhd.demon.co.uk).


Nethack, being the addictive game that it is, obviously leaves the player
vastly less time to write messages for newsgroups than he would otherwise
have. As a result of this, the rec.games.roguelike.nethack newsgroup is
full of cryptic looking acronyms and abbreviations.

This spoiler contains a list of all the more popular (and some of the less
popular) acronyms that you might find on your journey through the
newsgroup.

The following convention has become popular amongst many of the
rec.games.roguelike.nethack inhabitants for abbreviations: the symbol used
within the game to represent the object proceeds the abbreviation to make
things clearer. So for example, a potion of confusion would be abbreviated
to "!PoC". Also, a lowercase 'b' or 'c' may sometimes be added to the start
to indicate blessed/cursed status. For example, 'b?SoG' might be used to
indicate a blessed scroll of genocide.

Good luck!
